## Derivatives in R

```{r}
fx <- expression(3.1 * (x ^ 4) - 28 * x)

# tell R to take derivative with respect to x
# store derivative expression
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

# this calls it back (show me!)
df_dx

x <- 10

eval(df_dx)
```

Find slope of g(z) = 2z^3^ - 10.5z^2^ + 4.1 at z = 3.6

```{r}
gz <- expression(2 * (z ^ 3) - 10.5 * (z ^ 2) + 4.1)

dg_dz <- D(gz, 'z')

dg_dz

z <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)

eval(dg_dz)
```
